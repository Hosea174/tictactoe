## Project Description

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using OpenGL and GLUT. The game is played in a window with a grid of 3x3 cells. Players take turns clicking on the cells to place their mark (X or O). The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
